After nearly two years of hard work, I am excited to announce [Foundations of Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.fp-tower.com/courses/foundations), is now available on Early Access! 

Foundation is a self-paced online course that focuses on the practical side of functional programming. You will learn to write programs that are both robust and easy to maintain as we cover the foundational knowledge required to make you a confident, productive, and skilled functional Scala developer.

The course will contain six chapters totalling around 20 hours of training covering topics such as parallel data processing, error handling and interactions with external systems. A detailed synopsis is available [here](https://www.fp-tower.com/courses/foundations#synopsis).

Foundation has been designed to suit both beginner and intermediate-level Scala developers with only a basic understanding of Scala syntax required. All exercises have answers and detailed walkthrough videos covering testing, refactoring techniques and working with an IDE. I have designed the course to imitate the experience of pair-programming with an experienced developer, which, in my view, is by far the best way to learn.

The course is currently on Early Access, which means you will get access to the course before it is complete at a heavily discounted price. This also means you can help to shape the development of the upcoming modules too.

The first two chapters, and most of the third, are available now, featuring native subtitling in six languages, written by experienced Scala developers:
