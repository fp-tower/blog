We recently started the development of the next major version of Monocle, Monocle [3.x](https://github.com/julien-truffaut/Monocle/tree/3.x). 
In this post, I would like to explain our objectives and discuss some of the changes we intend to make.

Monocle 3.x will be a complete rewrite. It doesn't mean we will change everything, but we will 
question every aspect of the library: optics encoding, API, names, dependencies, etc. We 
defined the following objectives to help us make trade-offs in the new design:
1. **User-friendly interface.** A user should be able to perform the most common actions without requiring in-depth knowledge of optics.
1. **Correctness.** Optics follow certain essential principles. Those rules may not be intuitive, but without them, optics 
are not a useful abstraction. The API should make it easy to follow those principles and avoid any undesired behaviours.
1. **Focus on Scala 3.** The next major version of Scala is coming [soon](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2018/04/19/scala-3.html), 
we should design the API firstly with Scala 3 in mind.
1. **Performance.** Optics are slower than handwritten equivalent code. Nevertheless, we should aim to limit this performance
 hit as much as possible.

Here are some of the specific changes we have in mind. Everything is still on the table; please voice your opinion
in Monocle [gitter](https://gitter.im/julien-truffaut/Monocle) or issue [tracker](https://github.com/julien-truffaut/Monocle/issues).

## Inheritance between optics

There exists a fundamental inheritance relationship between optics. An `Iso` is a valid `Lens`. A `Lens` is a legitimate 
`Optional`, and so on. The following diagram summarises the optics hierarchy in Monocle.

![Example image](/images/monocle-optics-hierarchy.svg)

Currently, in Monocle, optics do not extend one another. Instead, we provide `asX` method to manually upcast optics which
is inconvenient for end-users.

```scala
val name: Lens[Person, String] = ???

// Monocle 1.x and 2.x
val nameOptional: Optional[Person, String] = name.asOptional

// Monocle 3.x
val nameOptional: Optional[Person, String] = name
```

The first version of Monocle used inheritance; this was in 2014! However, we encountered some issues with `compose` that 
motivated us to "temporarily" remove inheritance. Retrospectively, it was a mistake. We should not have favoured ease of 
implementation over ease of utilisation.

## Object API for most common optics composition

Composing optics is very similar to composing functions; you need to make the type match, e.g. composing an `Optic[A, B]` 
and an `Optic[B, C]`, gives you an `Optic[A, C]`. Since optics inherit from one another, we can often compose two different
types of optics; the resulting optic type will be the least upper bound (LUB) of the two types. For example, if you compose 
a `Lens[A, B]` with a `Prism[B, C]`, you get an `Optional[A, C]` because `Optional` is the first common parent of `Lens` and 
`Prism` (see full [table](http://julien-truffaut.github.io/Monocle/optics.html#optic-composition-table)).

In practice, some of the transformations are extremely common. Say we have a `Lens[Person, Option[Email]]`, and we want to focus
into the `Some` part of the `Option` or we have a `Lens[Invoice, List[Item]]`, and we want to go a particular index in the list.
For those common operations, we can provide a dedicated method on all optics:

```scala
optic.some.at("hello").each

optic.composePrism(some).composeLens(at("hello")).composTraversal(each)
```

This feature should make the API more IDE friendly and reduce the learning curve for new users.

## Use variance in optic's type parameters [#771](https://github.com/julien-truffaut/Monocle/issues/771)

A `Getter[A, B]` is equivalent to `A => B`. So the variance of `Getter` should be the same as `=>`, covariant in A, 
the input and contravariant in B, the output. If you are like me and have trouble putting your head around variance, you 
will find a great resource in [Thinking with types](https://leanpub.com/thinking-with-types).

```scala
trait Getter[-A, +B] {
  def get(from: A): B
}
```

On the other hand, a `Lens[A, B]` is equivalent to a pair of function `(get: A => B, set: (A, B) => A)`. Both A and B appear 
in covariant and contravariant positions, which means `Lens` must be invariant in A and B.

```scala
trait Lens[A, B] extends Getter[A, B] { 
  // A is both an input and ouput of set
  def set(from: A, newValue: B): A 
}
```

Similarly, all write optics are invariant, but it turns out that their polymorphic cousin is not. For example, a `PolyLens[A1, A2, B1, B2]` 
is a pair of function `(get: A1 => B1, set: (A1, B2) => A2)`. Now, both A1 and B2 are in contravariant position and A2 
and B1 are in covariant position.

```scala
trait PolyLens[-A1, +A2, +B1, -B2] extends Getter[A1, B1] { 
  def set(from: A1, newValue: B2): A2
}
```
 
Thank you, Adam Fraser and John De Goes for the idea. Also, thanks to Georgi Krastev for pointing out monomorphic 
`Lens` can inherit `Getter` with variance.

Regrettably, polymorphic optics bring other [issues](https://github.com/julien-truffaut/Monocle/issues/770). So it is 
unclear if we will keep them in 3.x or if Monocle will only support monomorphic optics.

## 0 dependency core

A project with no dependency present several advantages:
* Modularity. End-users may want a better syntax for modifying case classes without adding cats to their code base.
* Independent release cycle. We don't need to release a new version every time an upstream dependency is upgraded.
* More flexibility. We can experiment more easily with plugins and language features (e.g. Scala 3) without waiting for
dependencies to support them.
* Smaller footprint. It is particularly significant for other platforms like Scala.js.

Monocle core module only depends on a one functional library, [scalaz](https://scalaz.github.io/7/) in 1.x, [cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) 
in 2.x. Monocle exposes a couple of functions using typeclasses like `modifyF`, `Prism.below`, or `Traversal.fromTraverse`. Still, 
the main reason for this dependency is the encoding of  `Traversal`. 

We use the Van Laarhoven encoding for `Traversal`, which means we define all functions within `Traversal` in terms of `modifyF`.

```scala
trait Traversal[A, B] {
  def modifyF[F[_]: Applicative](f: B => F[B])(from: A): F[A]
}
```

It is still unclear if we can find an alternative encoding of `Traversal` without a dependency on cats 
(see [issue](https://github.com/julien-truffaut/Monocle/issues/766)). Assuming we find a suitable encoding one, we can 
then create a cats interop module where we would define all cats specific methods and instances. Unfortunately, end-users 
will need an additional import to access those functionality. We need to evaluate how often this extra import will be required.

## Rename all compose methods to andThen [#768](https://github.com/julien-truffaut/Monocle/issues/768)

Optics and functions compose in the same way; you need to make the type match a bit like in a puzzle.

```scala
def compose[A, B, C](f: B => C, g: A => B): A => C
def compose[A, B, C](f: Optic[A, B], g: Optic[B, C]): Optic[A, C]
```

You may have noticed that the parameters of optics composition are the inverse of function composition. Optics composition 
looks more like `andThen`  than `compose`.

```scala
def andThen[A, B, C](f: A => B, g: B => C): A => C
def compose[A, B, C](f: Optic[A, B], g: Optic[B, C]): Optic[A, C]
```

Therefore, I propose to rename all the `compose` methods in optics to `andThen`:

```scala
def andThenLens[A, B, C](f: Lens[A, B], g: Lens[B, C]): Lens[A, C]
def andThenPrism[A, B, C](f: Prism[A, B], g: Prism[B, C]): Prism[A, C]
// ...
```

For those curious about the abstraction behind function and optics, it is called [Category](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/cats/arrow/Category.scala). 
We can also use the "standard" symbolic alias for `andThen`, `>>>` (see [Compose](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/cats/arrow/Compose.scala)). 

```scala
person >>> address >>> streetNumber
```
